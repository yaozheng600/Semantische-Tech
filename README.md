# Semantische-Tech
Documentation of Project Semantische Technologie FUB, SS2021

### Abschlussbericht
Software project: semantic technology has been finished. In order to inspire the future work, I wrote this summary report.
#### team colaboration
Our project simulates the situation of a real commercial project. 
In the project, Dr. Jamal Al Qundus and Silvio Peikert of Fraunhofer FOKUS, as clients, put forward demands to the student team. 
The student team consists of 5 people, among which Raimi and Boyan are the team leaders, responsible for the planning and task assignment of the entire project.
Fang, Yanan and I are team members and responsible for completing the assigned tasks.   

We have a meeting every week. At the meeting we show the progress of our project, listen to the opinions of customers, discuss and assign the next work. 
In usual days we use slack to communicate and exchange ideas. We created gitlab to store all the code and document our work report in the wiki.      

Because of the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic, we can only communicate online. This increases the efficiency and cost of communication. 
And members cannot communicate face to face, which does not allow members to get enough support. In addition, during the project, because my computer broke down,
I lost contact with the team for a week. So I think if we can meet offline, our communication will be more efficient.

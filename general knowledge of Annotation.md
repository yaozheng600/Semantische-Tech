### Defination
**Annotation**: Any metadata tag used to mark up elements of the dataset.          
**Corpora**: Datasets of natural language.        
**Corpus**: A single set of data annotated with the same specification.       

### Chapter 1
#### The Layers of Linguistic Description
this part gives us some definations of different layers of the human language system, namely syntax, semantics, morphology, phonology (and phonetics), and the lexicon.      
All of the layers of linguistic research, from phonetics to semantics to discourse analysis, are used in different combinations for different ML tasks.
#### Some of the major areas of NLP include:
1. Question Answering Systems (QAS)
2. Summarization
3. Machine Translation
4. Speech Recognition
5. Document classification
#### Two useful corpus
1. Google Ngram Corpus
2. ClueWeb09:      
This corpus is too large to use for an annotation project (itâ€™s about 25 terabytes uncompressed), but some projects have taken parts of the dataset (such as a subset of the English websites) and used them for research
#### Kinds of Annotation
1. part of speech(POS)
2. syntactic bracketing (or labeling)
3. Semantic typing
4. Semantic role labeling
#### The Annotation Development Cycle: MATTER methodology     
subportions of MATTER:
1. MAMA 
2. TTER        
Often before reaching the Test step of the process, the annotation scheme has already gone through several revisions of the Model and Annotate stages.
